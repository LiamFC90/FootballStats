To enter a new weeks data:
Open main.m; update week to current week/week to be entered; call 'get_points(teams,week)' to have program ask for each teams score that week by team name; after termination, new data will be stored and saved in scores.mat array.

To print figure and data:
run main.m with correct week set in main.m line(6) or call 'plot_it(teams,week)'.
To gather just statistical data without drawing figure, call 'get_stats(teams)'.
